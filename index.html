        <p> Books have been my best friend since I was quite young.I read a lot of books; fiction, non-fiction, biography, self-help, instructional, etc. I believe everyone should have a reading hobby. Harry Potter(I am a big Potterhead!), Percy Jackson, A wrinkle in a time are just a few names from my beloved mini book library(Actually its a shelf with a ton of books but I prefer calling it my mini library).<br><br>I am an avid reader of fictional literature because it is entertaining, thought-provoking and opens new imaginary world for me. I find a good detective fiction gets my brain cells working rapidly. Journalistic fiction inspires me to write factually. To strip my sentence of useless adornments and get straight to the point. I admire many authors and have begun quite a collection of their books. I collect the books which I revisit often because they are that good. I love books and that is why reading is my hobby.<br><br>Due to my hobby of reading books, I've developed a passion for writting stories. Books help increase my vocabulary and creativity and thus it makes it easier for me to write a novella(long short story or a short novel).<br><br> I would also like to encourage children like me to explore the wonderful world of books.</p>
